      "|(Our) world with COVID-19 ['MEDI', 'MEDI', 'MEDI', 'MEDI', 'MEDI', 'MEDI'] The pandemic COVID-19 certainly has terrible impact to the world. Not only on health issue, but other aspects which are unavoidably involved are environment, economics, politics, social and the new way of living. This new normal way of life certainly influences medical practice. The physicians of every expertise should acquire additional knowledge and be competent in taking care of an individual, patients, and even themselves to stay safe from the deadly virus. Some health technologies have been rapidly emerging to serve the needs of the world. A distinct example is COVID-19 vaccine invention, manufacturing, and distribution. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or new technology of Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines against the COVID-19 had extremely expedited production process and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval like it has never been before. Another example is a digital health which has been introduced for quite a while. A steep and expanding growth of various digital health technologies and artificial intelligence is more widely accepted and practiced e.g. telemedicine, health data sharing, medical applications, and etc. These digital health technologies are also incorporated with many business start-ups to serve necessities to live in a new way of life. The effects of COVID-19 to obstetrics and gynecology practices are also evidenced in both tangible and intangible aspects: safety issues related to the infection (medical care providers/ hospital management vs women/patients/ her family members), health outcomes (reproduction, perinatal, cancer), selective type of service (elective vs urgent vs emergent), education and training (face-to-face vs online), a balance of specialties needed now and in the upcoming future (reproductive endocrinologist, obstetricians, gynecologic oncologists), and etc. All of us, as a physician or as an individual, should stay safe, have knowledge and strength to sail safely through the virus-inducing storm.

      "|16S metagenomic analysis reveals adaptability of a mixed-PAH-degrading consortium isolated from crude oil-contaminated seawater to changing environmental conditions ['ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI', 'ENVI'] A bacterial consortium, named SWO, was enriched from crude oil-contaminated seawater from Phrao Bay in Rayong Province, Thailand, after a large oil spill in 2013. The bacterial consortium degraded a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) mixture consisting of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene (50 mg L−1 each) by approximately 73%, 69%, 52%, and 48%, respectively, within 21 days. This consortium exhibited excellent adaptation to a wide range of environmental conditions. It could degrade a mixture of four PAHs under a range of pH values (4.0–9.0), temperatures (25 °C–37 °C), and salinities (0–10 g L−1 with NaCl). In addition, this consortium degraded 20–30% of benzo[a]pyrene and perylene (10 mg L−1 each), high molecular weight PAHs, in the presence of other PAHs within 35 days, and degraded 40% of 2% (v/v) crude oil within 20 days. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis demonstrated that Pseudomonas and Methylophaga were the dominant genera of consortium SWO in almost all treatments, while Pseudidiomarina, Thalassospira and Alcanivorax were predominant under higher salt concentrations.

The targets were implanted within arterioles and subjected to an externally uniform applied magnetic field in order to increase the effectiveness of targeting magnetic drug carrier particles (MDCPs). The capture area (As) of the MDCPs was determined by inspection of the particle trajectories simulated from the particle equations of motion. The blood flow velocities at any particle position around the target were obtained by applying bilinear interpolation to the numerical blood velocity data. The effects on As of the type of ferromagnetic materials in the targets and MDCPs, average blood flow rates, mass fraction of the ferromagnetic material in the MDCPs, average radii of MDCPs (Rp) and the externally applied magnetic field strength (μ0H0) were evaluated. Furthermore, the appropriate μ0H0 and Rp for the IA-MDT design is suggested. In the case of the SS409 target and magnetite MDCPs, dimensionless capture areas ranging from 4.1- to 12.4 and corresponding to particle capture efficiencies of 31–94% were obtained with Rp ranging from 100- to 500 nm, weight fraction of 80%, μ0H0 of 0.6 T and an average blood flow rate of 0.01 ms−1. In addition, the more general 3-D modelling of IA-MDT in this work is applicable to IA-MDT using spherical targets implanted within blood vessels for both laminar and potential blood flows including the wall effect.

      "|34-kDa salivary protein enhances duck Tembusu virus infectivity in the salivary glands of Aedes albopictus by modulating the innate immune response ['MULT'] Duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) is an important flavivirus that can be transmitted to poultry via Aedes albopictus bites. Furthermore, humans residing in the DTMUV epidemic area display activated antiviral immune responses to local DTMUV isolates during the pathogenic invasion, thereby raising the primary concern that this flavivirus may be transmitted to humans via mosquito bites. Therefore, we identified the gene AALF004421, which is a homolog of the 34-kDa salivary protein (34 kDa) of Ae. albopictus and studied the salivary protein-mediated enhancement of DTMUV infection in Ae. albopictus salivary glands. We observed that double-stranded RNA-mediated silencing of the 34 kDa in mosquito salivary glands demonstrated that the silenced 34 kDa impaired DTMUV infectivity, similar to inhibition through serine protease. This impairment occurred as a consequence of triggering the innate immune response function of a macroglobulin complement-related factor (MCR). 34-kDa in the salivary gland which had similar activity as a serine protease, results in the abrogation of antimicrobial peptides production and strong enhance DTMUV replication and transmission. Although the function of the 34 kDa in Ae. albopictus is currently unknown; in the present study, we showed that it may have a major role in DTMUV infection in mosquito salivary glands through the suppression of the antiviral immune response in the earliest stages of infection. This finding provides the first identification of a prominently expressed 34 kDa protein in Ae. albopictus saliva that could serve as a target for controlling DTMUV replication in mosquito vectors.

      "|3D PED BURN app: A precise and easy-to-use pediatric 3D burn surface area calculation tool ['MEDI', 'MEDI', 'MEDI'] Background and aims: Calculating the precise total burn surface area is crucial when treating burn patients, particularly children. The Lund and Browder chart and Rule of Nines, 2-dimensional diagrams that are widely used, are subject to high interrater variance, and they can severely overestimate the burn area. Previously, the adult 3-dimensional burn area calculation mobile application was developed. Aiming to improve accuracy, a 3-dimensional pediatric burn surface area calculation mobile application (“3D PED BURN”) was developed to overcome the limitations of the conventional methods. Method: Fifteen 3-dimensional pediatric burn surface area models based on detailed anthropometric measurements collected from 85 patients were developed and categorized into four age groups: <1 year; 1–4 years; 5–9 years, and 10–15 years. According to their weight and height, the models in each group were fractionated into large, medium, and small body sizes. Result: A precise and easy-to-use application was developed based on these data. This application is a promising and more accurate calculation tool for burn surface area in pediatric patients. Its low inter-rater variance makes it reliable for use by various healthcare personnel. Conclusion: The 3D PED BURN app is a pediatric 3D burn surface area calculation tool that is both accurate and simple to use.

In this study, the stability of three-dimensional (3D) undrained clay slopes subjected to pseudo-static seismic load is investigated by utilising the finite element limit analysis (FELA) of rigorous upper and lower bounds. The FELA solutions are normalised and presented by a seismic stability number influenced by four dimensionless variables, namely, a depth factor, a slope length ratio, a slope inclination and a horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient. The impacts of a horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient on the mechanisms of 3D slope failures based on FELA are examined and discussed for the first time. The respective influence and sensitivity of each design parameter on the seismic stability number of 3D undrained slopes under the influence of seismic load is investigated using the multivariate adaptive regression spline analysis. A predicted equation that can be used to effectively estimate the seismic stability number, which can be of great interest to practitioners, is also developed.

Two detection techniques, including electrochemical detection and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric detection (LDI-MS), were used complementarily to improve the precision in the detection of BPA. The fluid sample was delivered to both detection zones by the capillary action, automatically generated from the fabricated microfluidic device. For an electrochemical sensor, two ballpoint pens filled with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) ink were used to print onto the paper with a contact printing method using a digital plotter. To further improve the sensitivity, zinc oxide (ZnO) was used to modify both electrochemical and LDI-MS detection zones. For BPA detection, high electrocatalytic properties and strong UV absorption of ZnO promote the electron transfer in the electrochemical sensor and ionization efficiency in LDI-MS with low interferences compared with a conventional organic matrix. Under optimal conditions, this platform showed a dual detection capability for BPA with a detection limit of 0.35 μM for electrochemical detection and with an ultralow detection limit of 0.01 pM for LDI-MS.

The FPU/CNT/PPy composites were prepared as photopolymer resin with various proportions of the three components. The composites successfully achieved a gauge factor of 91.9 at 20 percent strain with high durability in 100 stretching-releasing cycles. More than 85% of printing accuracy was also found under the DLP 3D printing method. The small deformation of the composites could be detected during the stretching-releasing process during time-dependent testing. Examples of simple human activity and complex spring motion could be successfully detected due to the high responsibility and reproducibility of the finger motion.

      "|A 2D field-consistent beam element for large displacement analysis using a rational Bézier representation with varying weights ['MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH', 'MATH'] This study develops a new 2D field-consistent Euler-Bernoulli beam element for the analysis of beam structures undergoing large displacements but small strains. The total Lagrangian description is considered in the derivation of finite element equations. Relationships between the cross-sectional rotation and displacements of the beam axis are derived, and consequently, the kinematics of the element are entirely described by the displacements of the beam axis. These relationships underlie the construction of field-consistent interpolations. Regarding geometric descriptions, the deformed configuration of an element is represented by a rational cubic Bézier curve. For better geometric representations of complex deformed configurations, some of the weights are treated as discrete unknowns. Several benchmark numerical examples are used to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed beam element. The merits of considering weights as discrete unknowns are verified through comparisons between elements having varying weights and stationary weights. Furthermore, the proposed beam element is found to be naturally free from membrane locking, and thus, no additional efforts are required to handle the locking issues.

      "|A 3D End-Effector Robot for Upper Limb Functional Rehabilitation of Hemiparesis Patients ['ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI'] Robot-assisted therapy is a new type of rehabilitation that allows for highly repetitive, intensive, adaptable, and quantifiable physical training. It is increasingly being used to restore motor function, particularly in stroke survivors with upper limb paresis. The end-effector type robot allows natural movements without complex structure which is ideal for functional rehabilitation training. A 3D end-effector base on a five-bar linkage has been proposed to improve the common end-effector type that covers mechanical design, dynamic control strategy, and application of rehabilitation training or exercise. The dynamic controllers are deweighting with gravity compensation, passive mobilization or active assistive, and the virtual spring-damper wall concept. These controllers are used for developing functional rehabilitation training or exercise from an engineering point of view based on experiences in developing various types of rehabilitation robots. The experiments, based on the performance of the controllers, have been conducted with healthy subjects. The experimental results have shown very promising results and can be extended to various types of functional rehabilitation.

      "|A BIM-Based Method to Automate Material and Resources Assessment for the Green Building Index (GBI) Criteria ['ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI', 'ENGI'] Sustainable or green building rating systems were developed in many countries. Green Building Index (GBI) is the rating system developed in Malaysia, which consists of six main criteria. Material and Resources (MR) assessment is one of the main criteria that require the quantification of building materials to calculate the cost of materials and giving GBI points. Conventionally, the assessment process is done manually, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology gives a new possibility to extracted material quantities instantly from a model, which can support the process of MR assessment. Therefore, this research aims to develop a BIM-MR integration method that integrates the material quantities extracted from BIM with the developed templates and scripts according to the GBI to form automatic assessment results. The prototype system was developed using Autodesk Revit and Dynamo extension, and the validation is done using a case study. With this system, the MR assessment report can be done automatically, which will save time and cost to produce the assessment documents.

Botulinum toxin injection technique is crucial to treat this condition.OBJECTIVETo improve injection techniques for masseter hypertrophy by elucidating the distribution of the injections within the masseter.METHODSThirty masseter muscles were divided into 6 groups of 5 muscles each. Each group received one 0.2- or 0.3-mL injection at Point A, B, or C according to a three-point technique. Muscle dimensions and dye of the primary and secondary dye spreading were measured.RESULTSThe average muscle length, width, and thickness were 69.87, 33.50, and 11.23 mm, respectively. The average primary longitudinal and horizontal spreading was 36.56 and 15.60 mm, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between 0.2- and 0.3-mL injections at each point.CONCLUSIONThe three-point technique best fits in the safe zone and should be the standard injection technique for masseter hypertrophy. Injection at Points B and C may create secondary spreading that affect the risorius muscle and the parotid gland which are the cause of asymmetrical smiling and xerostomia, respectively. The dosage should be adjusted according to the muscle volume and not only the thickness.

In recent decades, Cambodia has been affected by increased severity of drought. Since drought is a slowly evolving natural disaster, its negative impacts can be mitigated through monitoring and characterizing drought levels by assimilating data from one or several indicators into a single numerical index which is more readily usable than raw indicator data. This study performed a comparative assessment of three meteorological drought indices including Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Effective Drought Index (EDI), and Percent of Normal Precipitation (PNP) for the Baribo basin in Cambodia. The SPI, EDI, and PNP are generally able to be used for assessing drought severity and duration but with a slight difference in performance. The SPI is considered the best index for capturing the extreme and severe drought events, while the EDI is a cautious index for assessing drought duration. The Baribo and Kraing Ponley sub-basins located in the middle and southern parts of the entire Baribo are considered the drought-prone area.

In this paper, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art results on two Thai social text categorization tasks can be realized by pretraining a language model on a large noisy Thai social media corpus of over 1.26 billion tokens and later fine-tuned on the downstream classification tasks. Due to the linguistically noisy and domain-specific nature of the content, our unique data preprocessing steps designed for Thai social media were utilized to ease the training comprehension of the model. We compared four modern language models: ULMFiT, ELMo with biLSTM, OpenAI GPT, and BERT.

Methods: Eighty-Six patients who underwent 1–2 levels of MIS-TLIF were randomly allocated to receive a TiPEEK or PEEK cage. Patient-reported outcomes were recorded using visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and EuroQoL-5D-5L. Postoperative radiographs and computed tomography were assessed for spinal fusion and cage subsidence. Results: The eligible 82 patients (41 patients, 49 operated levels in TiPEEK group and 41 patients, 50 operated levels in PEEK group) were included in the final analysis. Over total follow-up, the mean difference in visual analog scale back and leg pain scores between TiPEEK versus PEEK group was −0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.5 to 0.4; P = 0.85) and −0.12 (95% CI, −0.6 to 0.3; P = 0.62), respectively. The mean difference in Oswestry Disability Index scores was −0.71 (95% CI, −3.8 to 2.4; P = 0.65), and the mean difference in EQ-5D-5 L was 0.03 (95% CI, −0.01 to 0.06; P = 0.11) in TiPEEK group versus PEEK group as a reference. TiPEEK showed significantly higher fusion rates than PEEK at 6-month (91.8% vs. 76%; P = 0.03), but no difference at 12-month postoperation. There was no significant difference in cage subsidence rates between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The patient-reported outcomes showed significant improvements at 6- and 12-month postoperation following MIS-TLIF; the differences in those with TiPEEK versus PEEK cages were minimal with tight CIs. Fusion rates in both groups were ≥90%, with TiPEEK cages showing higher fusion rates at 6 months after the procedure.

The first pilot room was completed in 2014 with five more fully equipped and two semi-equipped large classrooms in the next three years. The rooms were only allocated to courses with active learning only; lecturers who requested to use the classroom had to pass through the training. By the end of 2016, the classrooms were used around 48% of the working hour for regular courses, and 14% of all lecturers passed through the utilization training.
