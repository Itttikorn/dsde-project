This study showed that all formulated diets were well accepted by the snails throughout the culture period. There were no significant differences in body weight gain, shell length increment and growth rate among the feeding experiments. No significant differences were observed in feed conversion ratio among the dietary treatments ranging from 4.35 to 4.77. Survival was high ranging from 98.00% to 100% and no significant differences in survival were observed.
