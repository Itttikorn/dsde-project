Thermoelectric generators (TEG) were hypothesized for its potential role of battery charger to serve the shining PCED market. Hence, this paper, mainly focusing at the metropolitan market in Thailand, aimed to conduct architectural innovation foresight and to develop scenarios on potential exploitation approach of PCED battery power supply with TEG charger converting power from ambient heat source adjacent to individual's daily life. After technical review and assessment for TEG potential and battery aspect, the business research was conducted to analyze PCED consumer behavior for their PCED utilization pattern, power supply lack problems, and encountering heat sources/sinks in 3 modes: daily life, work, and leisure hobbies. Based on the secondary data analysis from literature and National Statistical Office of Thailand, quantitative analysis was applied using the cluster probability sampling methodology, statistically, with the sample size of 400 at 0.05 level of significance. In addition, the qualitative analysis was conducted to emphasize the rationale of consumer's behavior using in-depth qualitative interview. Scenario planning technique was also used to generate technological and market trend foresight. Innovation field and potential scenario for matching technology with market was proposed in this paper. The ingredient for successful commercialization of battery power supply with TEG charger for PCED market consists of 5 factors as follows: (1) PCED characteristic, (2) potential ambient heat sources/sinks, (3) battery module, (4) power management module, and the final jigsaw (5) characteristic and adequate arrangement of TEG modules. The foresight outcome for the potential innovations represents a case study in the pilot commercialization of TEG technology for some interesting niche markets in metropolitan area of Thailand, and, thus, can be the clue for product development related to TEG for market-driven application in other similar requirement conditions and contexts as well. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Physics.", "correspondence": {"affiliation": {"city-group": "Phatumwan, 10330 Bangkok", "country": "Thailand", "address-part": "Phayathai Rd.", "@country": "tha", "organization": [{"$": "Technopreneurship and Innovation Management Program"}, {"$": "Graduate School"}, {"$": "Chulalongkorn University"}]}, "person": {"ce:initials": "S.", "ce:surname": "Maolikul", "ce:indexed-name": "Maolikul S."}}, "citation-info": {"author-keywords": {"author-keyword": [{"$": "Foresight", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, {"$": "Innovation", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, {"$": "Portable Consumer Electronic Device (PCED)", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, {"$": "Portable Power Supply", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, {"$": "Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)", "@xml:lang": "eng"}]}, "citation-type": {"@code": "cp"}, "citation-language": {"@language": "English", "@xml:lang": "eng"}, "abstract-language": {"@language": "English", "@xml:lang": "eng"}}, "source": {"sourcetitle-abbrev": "AIP Conf.
