It then goes on to explore how, and to what extent, tasks and duties assigned under the UN peacekeeping framework to the dispatched forces, as well as experiences and lessons the Thai armed forces gained from their participation in missions, contribute to the diffusion of norms and the development of functional competencies relating to peacekeeping and human security protection within the Thai military. The paper finds that while the dispatched forces received invaluable benefits in terms of prestige, economic rewards and learning experiences from the peacekeeping operations under the UN command, including approaches to humanitarian assistance during the time of acute conflict and monitoring human rights violations, the human security norm underlying these functional competencies has yet to be fully internalized by the military as an institution. Yet, there are some areas, especially in civil-military affairs where competencies developed from the internal security operations and international peacekeeping operations can be mutually reinforcing.", "prism:coverDate": "2014-11-26", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928614113", "dc:creator": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Keokam", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Keokam", "ce:initials": "K.", "ce:surname": "Kraisoraphong", "ce:indexed-name": "Kraisoraphong K."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "K.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:degrees": "Prof.", "ce:surname": "Kraisoraphong", "@auid": "55090204800", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55090204800", "ce:indexed-name": "Kraisoraphong K."}]}, "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928614113"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928614113&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928614113&origin=inward"}], "source-id": "19900191564", "citedby-count": "2", "prism:volume": "18", "subtype": "ar", "dc:title": "Thailand's Participation in UN Peacekeeping Missions", "openaccess": "0", "prism:issn": "18754112 18754104", "publishercopyright": "\u00a9 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV.", "prism:issueIdentifier": "3-4", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "prism:publicationName": "Journal of International Peacekeeping", "prism:pageRange": "236-255", "prism:endingPage": "255", "openaccessFlag": "false", "prism:doi": "10.1163/18754112-1804007", "prism:startingPage": "236", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:84928614113", "dc:publisher": "Martinus Nijhoff Publishers"}, "idxterms": null, "language": {"@xml:lang": "eng"}, "authkeywords": {"author-keyword": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "civil-military affairs"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "norm diffusion"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "peacekeeping operations"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "rationales for providing peacekeepers"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Thailand"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "United Nations"}]}, "subject-areas": {"subject-area": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pharmacology", "@code": "3004", "@abbrev": "PHAR"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Infectious Diseases", "@code": "2725", "@abbrev": "MEDI"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Virology", "@code": "2406", "@abbrev": "IMMU"}]}, "authors": {"author": [{"ce:given-name": "Keokam", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Keokam", "ce:initials": "K.", "ce:surname": "Kraisoraphong", "ce:indexed-name": "Kraisoraphong K."}, "@seq": "1", "ce:initials": "K.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60028190", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028190"}, "ce:degrees": "Prof.", "ce:surname": "Kraisoraphong", "@auid": "55090204800", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55090204800", "ce:indexed-name": "Kraisoraphong K."}, {"ce:given-name": "Brendan", "preferred-name": {"ce:given-name": "Brendan", "ce:initials": "B.", "ce:surname": "Howe", "ce:indexed-name": "Howe B."}, "@seq": "2", "ce:initials": "B.", "@_fa": "true", "affiliation": {"@id": "60001018", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001018"}, "ce:degrees": "Prof.", "ce:surname": "Howe", "@auid": "35147831500", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35147831500", "ce:indexed-name": "Howe B."}]}}}
