Chemical residue analysis of whole mangosteen, to ensure compliance with export standards, is challenging due to interference from the dark-colored phenolic components in the fruit peel. QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) technique has been developed for sample preparation to test pesticide residues in mangosteens by liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Extraction parameters, such as types of organic solvents and buffer agents, were optimized. Sorbent types and composition of dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) were evaluated for optimum interference removal. The final QuEChERS parameters for the extraction of 10 g homogenized whole mangosteen employed 10 mL acetonitrile/acetate buffer mixture followed by a d-SPE (1:1 PSA:alumina N) cleanup step. The final analysis was performed by LC-MS/MS. Mass spectral acquisition was done by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with two mass transitions per compound to provide quantification and confirmation. In-house validation parameters included: matrix-matched linearity, method accuracy, method precision, limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs).
